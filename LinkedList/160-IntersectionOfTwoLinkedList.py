    # For each of the N nodes in list A, we are traversing over each of the nodes in list B. In the worst case,
    # we won't find a match, and so will need to do this until reaching the end of list B, giving a worst-case time
    # complexity of O(NÃ—M).

    # of the input.

    # Complexity Analysis
    # Time complexity : O(N + M).
    # Firstly, we need to build up the hash table. It costs O(1) to insert an item into a hash table, and we need to do
    # this for each of the M nodes in list B. This gives a cost of O(M) for building the hash table.
    # Secondly, we need to traverse list A, and for each node, we need to check whether or not it is in the hash table.
    # In the worst case, there will not be a match, requiring us to check all N nodes in list A. As it is also O(1) to
    # check whether or not an item is in a hash table, this checking has a total cost of O(N).
    # Finally, combining the two parts, we get O(M) + O(N) =O(M+N).

    # Space complexity : O(M).
    # As we are storing each of the nodes from list B into a hash table, the hash table will require O(M) space.
    # Note that we could have instead stored the nodes of list A into the hash table, this would have been a space
    # complexity of O(N). Unless we know which list is longer though, it doesn't make any real difference.
